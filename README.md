# CryStall
Blend a video into a single picture !

## Introduction
CryStall takes a video file and creates a static image from it.
The image is rendered using the frames of the original video file.
Different methods of blending can be used to produce a variety of effects on the final result.

## Usage
`java -jar crystall.jar exmapleFile.mp4`

## Use short video files
The process is actually **EXTREMELY SLOW**.
